# Simple Arithmetic Compiler

This is a simple compiler for performing basic arithmetic operations. It takes input in the form of arithmetic expressions and generates the corresponding output.

## Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Handles integers as operands.
- Ignores whitespace characters in the input.
- Provides informative error messages for invalid syntax.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the compiler files are located.
4. Run the following command to execute the compiler:

   ```bash
   python compiler.py


Enter an arithmetic expression at the prompt and press Enter.
The compiler will parse the expression and display the result

$ python compiler.py
> 5 + 3 * 2
11
> 10 / 2 - 3
2
> 4 * (2 + 1)
12
> 8 / 0
Invalid syntax
> exit
